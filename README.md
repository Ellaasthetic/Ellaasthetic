## Passion Project: Security Guide from the Future  
As a cybersecurity enthusiast, I'm driven by a desire to help people stay safe online. That's why I created **Security Guide from the Future**, a project dedicated to empowering everyday people with the knowledge they need to navigate the digital world securely. 

**What do I do** 
- I research security best practices to create actionable, easy-to-understand content.  
- I design visually appealing postcards to make learning about security fun and engaging.  
- I dive deeper on Medium, where I write about each security tip on my postcard in a fun and engaging way, so you don't get bored.
